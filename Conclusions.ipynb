    "# Surprisingly enough, we can clearly see how the RL strategy out performs the CNN strategy by a huge margin. In retrospective it makes sense, as the CNN learnt a classification function and not to maximize the landing objective. If dig a little bit deeper, the idea of using a classifier to determine the actions in the openAI environment causes issues such as a positive feedback loop, to put it in an example: the CNN sees the frame and classifies it as an \"UP\", this \"UP\" is taken by the ENV an \"UP\" action is produced, then the next frame is a consequence of the action taken, then the classifier is most likely to see the current frame and say it is \"UP\" again, producing a positive feedback loop. Even if we had a nearly perfect classifier I believe this strategy would not work. Another issue in terms of classification is that the frames were recorded from an expert playing, meaning that our example distribution is small and not representative of the whole space, so a question arises with this: what happens when the ship goes to somewhere on the screen that it has never seen before? In these cases I believe the classifier is most likely to fail making the situation even worst.\n",
    "# Another thing that captured my interest was the disk space each of the models required, RL = 33 kb, CNN = 68 Mb, very impressive, we can see here how different architectures/strategies work better for the tasks they were actually built to work with. On top of this, the training for the CNN with 100 epochs took around three hours to finish, at the end I changed this to 25 epochs as I noticed that from there on classification accuracy increased very little, I also added a couple of layers to the head of the CNN architecture and reduced the number of neurons from 256 to 100 and 50 as the images are not that complex. Having said that the RL algorithm took around 20 minutes and the results were amazing."
